# node

This is just enough to get Node.js to start and run your script. It's JavaScript. Any valid JavaScript you put in index.js will run.

## Getting Started

In this directory, run:

```sh
yarn

yarn start
```

You should see something similar to:

```sh
yarn run v1.22.4
$ node index.js
Hello, world!
Done in 0.05s.
